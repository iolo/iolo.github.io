[Asia - Only Time Will Tell](https://youtu.be/AWs8SbT4__E)

```
You're leaving now
It's in your eyes
There's no disguising it
It really comes as no surprise
To find that you planned it all along

I see it now
Becomes so clear
Your insincerity
And me all starry-eyed
You'd think that I would have known by now

Now, sure as the sun will cross the sky
This lie is over
Lost, like the tears that used to tide me over

One thing is sure
That time will tell
(Only time will tell)
If you were wrong
The brightest ring around the moon
Will darken when I die

Now, sure as the sun will cross the sky
This lie is over
Lost, like the tears that used to tide me over

You're leaving now
It's in your eyes
There's no disguising it
It really comes as no surprise
To find that you planned it all along

I see it now
Becomes so clear
Your insincerity
And me all starry-eyed
You'd think that I would have known by now

Now, sure as the sun will cross the sky
This lie is over
Lost, like the tears that used to tide me over

You're on your own
Inside your room
(Only time will tell)
You're claiming victory
You were just using me
And there is no one you can use now

One thing is sure
That time will tell
```

Nothing is sure. Only time will tell.
